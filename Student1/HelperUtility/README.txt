This is the directory of my helper utility code. 

Generic and should be functional for all test code for all clients. 

Many repetitive tasks such as:
~ Test a string as either a number
~ Pausing execution of tasks. 
~ Email success or failure of test code

The code in Utility project can be added to almost every one of my test cases.  

Please don't delete or modify this without informing Scott Stemen.  It could affect much of my automated testing. 

Thank you
Scott
