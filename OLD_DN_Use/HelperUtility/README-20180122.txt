/* 20180122 Removing superfluous code that was related to BWA or seperating Asserts out of BWA code. */


/* 20180118 SBS use this before moving into your GIT */
This is the directory of my helper utility code. 

Many repetitive tasks such as Logging into the site, or test a string as either a number and pausing execution of tasks. This is the kind of code in the Utility project.  It's added to almost every one of my test cases.  

Please don't delete or modify this without informing Scott Stemen.  It could affect much of my automated testing. 

Thank you
Scott
